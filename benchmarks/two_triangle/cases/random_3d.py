"""Random 3D DVF cases with fixed seeds for reproducibility.

Uses dvfopt.dvf.generate_random_dvf_3d which builds a smooth random vector
field of the requested shape. We provide grid sizes 16, 24, 32 across two
fold-severity levels (controlled by max_magnitude).

Note: 32 cubed is the upper end here; larger grids (64, 128) push baseline
SLSQP runtime past the per-cell timeout. Once active-set or multigrid
variants are validated, larger sizes can be added.
