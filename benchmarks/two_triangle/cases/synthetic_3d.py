"""Synthetic 3D single-tet-flip and 6-tet-bowtie cases.

Built directly as displacement arrays rather than via correspondences —
the 3D Laplacian solver is heavier and the failure modes we want to
exercise (single-vertex folds, 6-tet bowties) are easier to specify
explicitly. Mirrors the patterns from notebooks 12a and 12c.
