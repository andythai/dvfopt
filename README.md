# Deformation Field Correction

Correct **negative Jacobian determinants** (folding) in 2D and 3D displacement fields produced by image registration. Three correction methods are provided — a fast heuristic, a full-grid constrained optimizer, and an iterative windowed optimizer — all ensuring the corrected field stays as close as possible to the original while eliminating folding.

## Background

Deformable image registration computes a displacement field $\phi$ that maps each pixel in a fixed image to its corresponding location in a moving image. When the Jacobian determinant of $\phi$ becomes negative at a pixel, the mapping **folds** — meaning the deformed grid crosses over itself both locally and globally, creating a physically implausible transformation.

This project corrects such folding by minimally adjusting the displacement field so that $J_{\det}(\phi) > 0$ everywhere, while keeping the corrected field as close to the original as possible. This is posed as a constrained optimization problem, which can be applied as a post-processing step to any existing registration pipeline.

## Problem Formulation

Given an input displacement field $\phi_{\text{init}}$ with regions of negative Jacobian determinant, find a corrected field $\phi^*$ that solves:

$$\phi^* = \arg\min_\phi \|\phi - \phi_{\text{init}}\|_2$$

subject to:

$$J_{\det}(\phi)(x, y) \geq \tau \quad \forall \; (x, y) \in \Omega$$

where $\tau = 0.01$ is the Jacobian determinant threshold (strictly positive) and $\Omega$ is the spatial domain.

The L2 norm objective ensures correction minimality — the optimizer finds the smallest displacement change that eliminates all folding.

## Jacobian Determinant

### 2D Computation

For a displacement field with components $(u_x, u_y)$, the deformation gradient is:

$$F = I + \nabla u = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y} \\[4pt] \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} & 1 + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \end{pmatrix}$$

The Jacobian determinant is the determinant of $F$:

$$J_{\det} = \left(1 + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}\right) - \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}$$

Spatial derivatives are computed via `np.gradient` (central differences at interior pixels, one-sided at boundaries). This matches SimpleITK for interior pixels while avoiding the ~3 ms/call overhead that made SLSQP numerical gradients infeasible.

- $J_{\det} = 1$: no deformation (identity)
- $J_{\det} > 1$: local expansion
- $0 < J_{\det} < 1$: local compression
- $J_{\det} \leq 0$: **folding** (invalid, needs correction)

### 3D Computation

The 3D deformation gradient $F \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$. Its determinant is computed via cofactor expansion along the first row:

$$\det(F) = a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{32}) - a_{12}(a_{21}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{31}) + a_{13}(a_{21}a_{32} - a_{22}a_{31})$$

where $a_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}$, computed from 9 partial derivatives via `np.gradient`.

## Correction Methods

### 1. Heuristic (Neighborhood Mean Vector Filter)

**Notebook:** `heuristic-neg-jacobian.ipynb`

The fastest but least accurate method. Replaces displacement vectors in the neighborhood of negative-Jdet pixels with the local mean:

1. Compute Jacobian determinant over the entire field
2. Find all pixels where $J_{\det} \leq 0$
3. For each negative pixel at $(y, x)$:
   - Extract the 3×3 neighborhood centered on $(y, x)$
   - Compute the mean displacement vector (excluding the center)
   - Replace displacement vectors in the 3×3 neighborhood with this mean
4. Repeat until no negative Jacobian determinants remain (or max iterations)

**Tradeoff:** Fastest convergence, but highest L2 error (largest deviation from original field). No optimality guarantee.

### 2. Full-Grid SLSQP

**Entry point:** `_full_grid_step()` in `modules/dvfopt.py`

Optimizes the entire displacement field simultaneously via Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP):

1. Flatten the full $(2, H, W)$ displacement field into a single vector $\phi$
2. Run `scipy.optimize.minimize(method='SLSQP')` with:
   - **Objective:** $\min \|\phi - \phi_{\text{init}}\|_2$
   - **Constraint:** $J_{\det}(\phi)(x, y) \geq 0.01$ for all interior pixels
3. Reshape the result back to $(2, H, W)$

**Tradeoff:** Lowest L2 error (globally optimal), but slowest — runtime scales quadratically with grid size since all pixels are optimized together.

### 3. Iterative SLSQP

**Entry point:** `iterative_with_jacobians2()` in `modules/dvfopt.py`

The primary method. Instead of optimizing the full grid, it repeatedly identifies the worst folding region and corrects it with a small local optimization:

```
1. Compute Jacobian determinant over full grid
2. While any interior pixel has J_det <= threshold - ε:
   a. Find the interior pixel with the lowest J_det
   b. Identify the connected component of negative-J_det pixels
      around it (8-connectivity)
   c. Compute the bounding box of that component,
      expand by +1 pixel on all sides (minimum 3×3)
   d. Extract the sub-window of displacement vectors
   e. Freeze edge pixels of the window to their initial values
   f. Run SLSQP on the sub-window:
      - Objective: minimize L2 distance from initial
      - Constraint: J_det >= 0.01 at all interior window pixels
      - Linear constraint: edge pixels remain fixed
   g. Write corrected sub-window back into the full field
   h. If window didn't converge, grow by +2 pixels and retry
   i. If window reached full grid size, run full-grid fallback
3. Return corrected field
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Adaptive window sizing:** The bounding-box approach ensures each window is only as large as needed, keeping the per-step optimization fast.
- **Frozen edges:** Edge pixels of each sub-window are constrained to their initial values. This prevents "pushing" negativity outside the window. The +1 positive-border expansion ensures frozen edges are feasible.
- **Edge feasibility check:** Before running the optimizer, the algorithm verifies that frozen edge pixels have positive Jacobian determinants. If not, it grows the window (by +2 pixels each dimension) and retries.
- **Full-grid fallback:** For non-square grids where the window has grown to grid size, falls back to full-grid SLSQP as a last resort.

**Tradeoff:** Near-optimal L2 error with substantially faster runtime than full-grid SLSQP, especially for fields with sparse folding regions.

### Hybrid Parallel Variant

**Entry point:** `iterative_parallel()` in `modules/dvfopt.py`

Extends the iterative method to process multiple non-overlapping windows simultaneously:

1. Identify **all** negative-Jdet pixels, sorted worst-first
2. Assign each an adaptive window size (bounding box + border)
3. **Greedy batch selection:** Pick the worst pixel's window, then greedily add windows that don't overlap any selected window
4. **Execute batch:**
   - Single window → run serially (avoids process-spawn overhead)
   - Multiple windows → dispatch to `ProcessPoolExecutor` in parallel
5. Apply all results, recompute Jacobian, repeat
6. **Escalation:** If a batch produces no improvement, force all windows to grow by +2 globally, increasing the chance of convergence at the cost of serialization

## Constraints

### Primary: Jacobian Determinant

The core constraint ensuring no folding:

$$J_{\det}(\phi)(x, y) \geq 0.01 \quad \forall \; \text{interior pixels}$$

Implemented as a `NonlinearConstraint` in SciPy's SLSQP. The threshold is strictly positive (not $\geq 0$) to provide a margin against numerical drift.

### Frozen Edges (Linear)

Edge pixels of each optimization window are fixed:

$$\phi_k = \phi_{k}^{\text{init}} \quad \forall \; k \in \text{edge indices}$$

Implemented as a `LinearConstraint` with a selection matrix $A$ that picks edge pixel entries from the flattened $\phi$ vector. This prevents the optimizer from shifting folding outside the window.

### Optional: Shoelace Area

Cell-based fold detection via the shoelace formula for signed area of each deformed quadrilateral cell:

$$A_{\text{cell}} = \frac{1}{2}\left|(x_0 y_1 - x_1 y_0) + (x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1) + (x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2) + (x_3 y_0 - x_0 y_3)\right|$$

where $(x_0, y_0), \ldots, (x_3, y_3)$ are the deformed quad vertices (TL, TR, BR, BL). Positive signed area means no geometric fold. Enabled via `enforce_shoelace=True`.

### Optional: Injectivity (Monotonicity)

Forward-difference check ensuring the deformed grid remains monotonically ordered:

$$1 + u_x[i, j+1] - u_x[i, j] > 0 \quad \text{(horizontal)}$$
$$1 + u_y[i+1, j] - u_y[i, j] > 0 \quad \text{(vertical)}$$

This is a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for global injectivity on a structured grid with unit spacing. Enabled via `enforce_injectivity=True`.

## 3D Extension

The 3D extension in `modules/dvfopt3d.py` generalizes all 2D operations:

| Aspect | 2D | 3D |
|--------|----|----|
| Deformation shape | $(3, 1, H, W)$ | $(3, D, H, W)$ |
| Jacobian matrix | $2 \times 2$ | $3 \times 3$ determinant via cofactor expansion |
| Connected component | 8-connectivity | 26-connectivity (3×3×3 structuring element) |
| Frozen boundary | 4 edges | 6 faces of sub-volume |
| Phi packing | $[\text{dx}, \text{dy}]$ | $[\text{dx}, \text{dy}, \text{dz}]$ |
| Constraint indices | 2 per pixel | 3 per voxel |

The iterative algorithm is structurally identical — find worst voxel, compute 3D bounding box, extract sub-volume, freeze 6 faces, run SLSQP, write back.

## Data Conventions

- **Deformation fields:** `(3, 1, H, W)` NumPy arrays with channels `[dz, dy, dx]`. For 2D work the z-slice dimension is 1.
- **Pull-back convention:** Each displacement vector points from a fixed-image pixel to its source in the moving image: $\text{fixed} + \text{displacement} = \text{moving}$.
- **Coordinate ordering:** `[z, y, x]` everywhere. Correspondences are `(N, 3)` arrays.
- **SimpleITK interop:** Arrays are transposed `(3,1,H,W)` → `(1,H,W,3)` and axis-reordered `[2,1,0]` (zyx → xyz) before calling SimpleITK.
- **Phi flattening:** During optimization, the displacement field is flattened as `phi[:len(phi)//2]` = dy, `phi[len(phi)//2:]` = dx (2D) or `[dx, dy, dz]` concatenated (3D).
- **Plotting:** `meshgrid` with `indexing='xy'`; y-axis inverted to match image convention.
